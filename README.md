```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn
- Supabase account (for backend)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
cd ai-agent-workbench
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Supabase credentials
```

4. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm test` - Run unit tests
- `npm run test:ui` - Run tests with UI
- `npm run test:coverage` - Generate coverage report

deno test --allow-all __tests__/*.test.ts
```

### CI Pipeline

Every PR and push to `main`/`develop` triggers automated checks:

1. **Lint** - ESLint code quality checks
2. **Frontend Tests** - 310+ test cases with 86%+ coverage
3. **Backend Tests** - Deno tests for edge functions
4. **Build** - Production build verification
5. **E2E Tests** - Playwright end-to-end tests

**Coverage enforcement:** Builds fail if coverage drops below 70%.

### Deployment Workflows

#### Staging (Auto-Deploy)
- **Trigger:** Push to `develop` branch
- **Process:** Tests → Build → Deploy edge functions → Deploy frontend → Health checks
- **URL:** `https://staging.ai-agent-workbench.com`

#### Production (Manual Approval Required)
- **Trigger:** Push to `main` branch or version tags
- **Process:**
  1. Pre-deployment checks (tests, lint, security audit, bundle size)
  2. **Manual approval required** (reviewers notified)
  3. Create deployment backup
  4. Deploy edge functions + frontend
  5. Run database migrations
  6. Health checks + smoke tests
  7. Automatic rollback on failure
- **URL:** `https://ai-agent-workbench.com`
